# Duotrigordle

This is the issue tracking repository for [Duotrigordle](https://duotrigordle.com). Please tag any issue or bug reports with the **(bug)** label and any feature requests with the **(enhancement)** label. I try my best to respond in a timely manner.

An old version of the frontend code is available on the `master` branch. Due to Duotrigordle now having a backend and running advertising, all future development is done in a private repository. Thank you for all those who contributed!
